# Avoiding Pedestrian with Neural Network

__This is still a work in developement, not everything works.__

## Pre-req:
Tensorflow, ROS Kinetic, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (14.04 LTS might work but not tested), libfreenect, freenect_stack, OpenCV, ...

## Instructions:
Just clone this repo into your catkin_ws/src directory.

__I'm still working on the structure of the project, and deciding what nodes will be running.__
